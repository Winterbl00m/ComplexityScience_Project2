Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

Replicating evolutionary ultimatum game to find evolution of fairness. Your motivating question for the replication part is not particularly clear

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I don't really understand how your extension evolution works. Wouldn't genotypes only change when players are replicating? Changing genotypes based on memory doesn't really make sense to me.

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Looks good, although a little bit draft quality. In your interpretation, you mention seeing a niceness of 0.5 and that possibly being a bimodal distribution of sorts. It'd be good to see a graph specifically showing that

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

I think the interpretation makes sense, but some more graphs would be good

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

It looks like you don't yet have the exact w-value graph, and your description of the experiment isn't including that. Are you planning to leave that part out?

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I think this all makes sense except for the methodology point I raised above

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Yeah

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?'

Yes, but proofread and update and stuff

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yeah
