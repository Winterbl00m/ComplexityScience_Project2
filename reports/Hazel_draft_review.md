Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
THe team first replicates a basic evolutionary ultimatum game. Then they try to understand how having multiple rounds against the same opponent will change stragies in a population when playing the ultimatum game. 

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
I think that I am still a little bit confused about their methodology. There model seems to be an evolutionary model where agents can "change their own genotypes." Normally, in evoltionary algortihms agents can't change only populations can, is that still true in this model? Also, what are the characteristics of each agents? From what I can tell each agents has a "maximum" offer (p), a "minimum" acceptance (q), and amount they change their offer after they got accepted, and amount they change their offer after being rejected, the amount they chage their acceoptance threshhold after accepting, and the amount they change their acceptance threshhold after rejecting. Is that correct?

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
It took a couple of readings, but I now think that I understand what each graph is showing although I am still a little bit confused by some of the data. For example in offer response to rejection the line hits -2.5. If this game is like the one in the orignal paper are the agents trying to split 1 object. If so, is this your agents inventing theft?

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
There isn't really a discussion in this paper. I assume because it just wasn't completed for the draft

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
This paper seems consistant with the original paper. The team displayed their results, although they did not display the original paper's results. From reading the paper I can tell that the results are similar. 

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The extension can answer a question that the original experiment cannot. See above section on methodology for further details 

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
The extension and replication are both completed. All that seems left is a discussion section and some cleaning of the rest of the report for clarity and this project seems done.

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?
The report is written well and is consistant with its audience and goals.

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 
Yes.
