# Explorations with the Ultimatum Game
## Mira Flynn, Hazel Smith

## Abstract
Much like Prisoner's dillemma, the Ultimatum Game illustrates how behaviors which is coorporative and detrimental in the short term can prove adaptive in the long term. The Ultimatum Game is relativly simple one, two players are trying to decide how to divide a resource between them. One player, the proposer, makes a proposal to the the other and the other, the responder, chooses whether or not to accept it.

The authors explore why humans choose reason when playing the Ultimatum Game. According to optimal strategies, the proposing player should offer the smallest amount to the responding player; however, humans tend to be more fair when playing the Ultimatum Game. The authors made a model which evolves strategies of players to find the strategies that dominate and reach a steady state. The base game always evolves toward the optimal strategy. However, if the players are given a chance to learn about previous encounters, the players instead evolve towards fairness, replicating how real people tend to behave.

## Next Steps (for this week)

For a variety of reasons, we do not plan to make any significant progress this week. The next steps once we do have time to work on this project will be to replicate the model as described in the paper, to give us a base from which to work.
