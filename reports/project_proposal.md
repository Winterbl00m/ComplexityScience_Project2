# Explorations with the Ultimatum Game
## Mira Flynn, Hazel Smith

## Abstract
Much like Prisoner's dillemma, the Ultimatum Game illustrates how behaviors which is coorporative and detrimental in the short term can prove adaptive in the long term. The Ultimatum Game is relativly simple one, two players are trying to decide how to divide a resource between them. One player, the proposer, makes a proposal to the the other and the other, the responder, chooses whether or not to accept it.
